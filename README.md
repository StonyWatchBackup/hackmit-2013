# Hack MIT 2013

This Git repository contains a presentation with links to Pebble development resources as well as two sample projects:

 - isstracker-simple: Shows how to display a background image, the current time and a countdown to a timestamp.
 - isstracker-http: This improved version automatically fetches from the Internet the timestamp of the next International Space Station pass over Boston

The server side component for isstracker-http is provided in isstracker-server. It's a nodejs application.

Your two main resources are:
 - http://developer.getpebble.com
 - http://www.cloudpebble.net

We are around during the event! Ping us on @pebbledev or look for our Pebble tshirts!

Good luck!
